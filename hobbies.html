            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>I really enjoy playing fantasy baseball.  I usually play in several leagues every year but the only one I really care about is the league I have been in for almost 20 years. 
            It is mostly made up of friends from high school and college (the first time) and we have a trophy that gets passed around to the winner each year.  The trophy was
            built by one of the guys who is a high school baseball coach and had access to a lot of old broken trophies that he took parts from.  Its an interesting trophy.
