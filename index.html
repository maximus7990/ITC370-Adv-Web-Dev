			<h1>Brian's Page</h1>
			<p>My name is Brian Bell and I'm a nontraditional student working on a degree in Network
				Infrastructure. Prior to Covid I managed movie theaters for almost 20 years, 
				including the Alamo Drafthouse here in Springfield.
			</p> 
				
			<p>I enjoy watching movies, playing video games and being entertained
				by my 3 dogs.				
				
				This is a picture of one of my goofball dogs.
